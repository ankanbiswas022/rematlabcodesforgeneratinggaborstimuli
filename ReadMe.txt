Note:
These folder contains the script which we have recieved from Vinay on March 13.
Following is the email from Vinay which describes the flow of the scripts.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"I had written a code to generate achromatic gabors, 
but not chromatic ones per say. So, I have made some additions to that, 
to convert the achromatic gabor to a colored one. 

Check the attached sample script and let me know if it works fine for you.

The main script is 'sampleDrawColorGabor.m' and the other two are supporting functions.
If you want to span some particular subspace of the DKL color space you may want 
to explore more and make necessary changes to this.
But the overall logic should remain the same, I think.

Also, let me know if there are any bugs in this. Thodi jaldi mein likh ke bhej raha hun."

Best!
Vinay
